# [Cinderpaw Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

I really only created this bot to have some fun with discord.py, and check out how bots work, without using node.js or any other icky JS stuff.

```python
isAwesome = true
shouldUse = true
link = 'https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=710938688829259886&permissions=8&scope=bot'
if isAwesome == true and shouldUse == true:
  print('link = {}'.format(link))
```

## Add to your server
### `NOTE: THE BOT IS STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, AND IS NOT PERMENANTLY HOSTED, DO NOT IMPLEMENT AT THIS TIME UNLESS YOU ARE A DEV OR TESTING!!!!`
* Click the title!
* Or if you're weird [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=710938688829259886&permissions=8&scope=bot) link.
